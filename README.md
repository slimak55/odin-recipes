##   Project Recipes
This is my take on the project recipes from The Odin Project.

Even though I think that I know most of the fundamentals from the Foundations Course, there are some interesting pointers, so I decided to take it anyway, but I will mostly stick to the assignment without making many changes, even when I saw other submissions.
